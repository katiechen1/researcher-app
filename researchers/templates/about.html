<h1>About</h1>
<p>We created the Women in Microfluidics & BioMEMS listing to assist conference chairs and organizers with identifying speakers, panelists, and moderators for inclusion in conferences and workshops having micro/nanofluidics and Bio-MEMS content. We encourage anyone who is in a position of suggesting or selecting speakers to use this list as a tool to help identify great researchers leading their own laboratories in micro/nanofluidics and Bio-MEMS (i.e., more senior than postdoctoral scholars).  Please submit nominations, as the Women in Microfluidics & BioMEMS list is designed to be only as comprehensive as we – our community – make it.  If you have questions or ideas, please contact Prof. Amy E. Herr at UC Berkeley.</p>
