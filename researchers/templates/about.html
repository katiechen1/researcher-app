<h1>About</h1>
<p>We created the Women in Microfluidics listing to assist conference chairs and organizers with identifying speakers, panelists, and moderators for inclusion in conferences and workshops having micro/nanofluidics and Bio-MEMS content.  We encourage anyone who is in a position of suggesting or selecting speakers to use this list as a tool to help identify great researchers to include in your conference, workshop, or university’s programming.  Please submit nominations, as the Women in Microfluidics list is designed to be only as comprehensive as we – our community – make it.  If you have questions or ideas, please contact Prof. Amy E. Herr at UC Berkeley.</p>
