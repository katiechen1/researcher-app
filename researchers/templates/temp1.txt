What is the Women in Microfluidics list? We are faculty and researchers working to enhance representation of women in our field. The Women in Microfluidics list aids our effort.

Why have you been nominated? You are considered a notable contributor to our field by a colleague, who took the time to nominate you. Our list is focused on established researchers in industry and academia (Assistant, Associate, Full Professor, to Emerita rank). If you would like to be included in our Women in Microfluidics list, please go to microfluidics.berkeley.edu/nomineeinfo to accept your nomination. We respect your privacy and will not share your information beyond what is viewable on our public Women in Microfluidics list. 

If you would like to nominate a stellar female colleague (or colleagues!) for inclusion on the Women in Microfluidics list, do so after accepting your own nomination. Please let others know about this list â€“ including leaders in our field and organizers of conferences/workshops/symposia.
